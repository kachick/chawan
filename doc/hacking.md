# Hacking

Some notes on modifying Chawan's code.

## Style

Refer to the [NEP1](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html) for the
basics. Also, try to keep the style of existing code.

### Casing

Everything is camelCase. Enums are camelCase too, but the first part is
an abbreviation of the type name. e.g. members of `SomeEnum` start with
`se`.

Exceptions:

* Types/constants use PascalCase. enums in cssvalues use PascalCase too,
  to avoid name collisions.
* Module-local templates use snake_case.
* It's easier to convert snake_case to kebab-case, so we use snake_case
  inside the config object. Note: this doesn't apply to objects created
  from values in the config object.
* We keep style of external C libraries, which is often snake_case.
* Chame is stuck with `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for its enums. This is
  unfortunate, but does not warrant an API breakage.

Rationale: consistency.

### Wrapping

80 chars per line.

Exceptions: URL comments.

Rationale: makes it easier to edit in vi.

### Spacing

No blank lines inside procedures (and other code blocks). A single blank
line separates two procs, type defs, etc. If your proc doesn't fit on
two 24-line screens, split it up into more procs instead of inserting
blank lines.

Exceptions: none. Occasionally a proc will get larger than two screens,
and that's ok, but try to avoid it.

Rationale: makes it easier to edit in vi.

### Param separation

Semicolons, not commas. e.g.

```nim
# Good
proc foo(p1: int; p2, p3: string; p4 = true)
# Bad
proc bar(p1: int, p2, p3: string, p4 = true)
```

Rationale: makes it easier to edit in vi.

### Naming

Prefer short names. Don't copy verbose naming from the standard.

Rationale: we aren't a fruit company.

### Comments

Comment what is not obvious, don't comment what is obvious. Whether
something is obvious or not is left to your judgment.

Don't paste standard prose into the code unless you're making a
point. If you do, abridge the prose.

Rationale: common sense, copyright.

## General coding tips and guidelines

These are not hard rules, but please try to follow them unless the
situation demands otherwise.

### Features to avoid

List of Nim features/patterns that sound like a good idea but aren't,
for non-obvious reasons.

#### Exceptions

Exceptions don't work well with JS embedding; use Result/Opt/Option
instead. Note that these kill RVO, so if you're returning large objects,
either make them `ref`, or use manual RVO (return bool, set var param).

#### "result" variable

The implicit "result" variable is great until you need to change the
procedure signature or manually inline a proc. Avoid it when possible.

#### Implicit initialization

Avoid, except for arrays. The correct way to create an object:

```nim
let myObj = MyObject(
  param1: x,
  param2: y
)
```

It's OK to leave out param3 and let it be zero-initialized. Also,
manually initializing arrays is annoying, so it's OK to do it
implicitly.

#### "out" parameters

They crash the 1.6.14 compiler. Use "var" for now.

#### Copying operations

substr and x[n..m] copies. Try to use toOpenArray instead, which is a
non-copying slice.

Note that `=` is not just assignment, it's a "copy" operator. If you're
copying a large object a lot, you may want to set its type to `ref`.

#### Generic parameters for JS values

Monoucha (our QuickJS wrapper) supports these, but they bloat code size
and compile times.

Similarly, `varargs[string]` works, but is less efficient than
`varargs[JSValue]`. (The former is first converted into a seq, while the
latter is just a slice.)

Use `?fromJS[T](ctx, val)` on JSValues manually instead.

### Fixing cyclic imports

In Nim, you can't have circular dependencies between modules. This gets
unwieldy as the HTML/DOM/etc. specs are a huge cyclic OOP mess.

The preferred workaround is global function pointer variables:

```nim
# Forward declaration hack
var forwardDeclImpl*: proc(window: Window; x, y: int) {.nimcall.}
# in the other module:
forwardDeclImpl = proc(window: Window; x, y: int) =
  # [...]
```

Don't forget to make it `.nimcall`, and to comment "Forward declaration
hack" above. (Hopefully we can remove these once Nim supports cyclic
module dependencies.)

## Debugging

Note: following text assumes you are compiling in debug mode, i.e.
`make TARGET=debug`.

### The universal debugger

"eprint x, y" prints x, y to stderr, space separated.

Normally you can view what you printed through the M-c M-c (escape + c
twice) console. Except when you're printing from the pager, then do `cha
[...] 2>a` and check the "a" file.

Sometimes, printing to the console triggers a self-feeding loop of
printing to the console. To avoid this, disable the console buffer:
`cha [...] -o start.console-buffer=false 2>a`. Then check the "a" file.

You can also inspect open buffers from the console. Note that you must
run these *before* switching to the console buffer (i.e. before the
second M-c), or it will show info about the console buffer.

* `pager.process`: the current buffer's PID.
* `pager.cacheFile`: the current buffer's cache file.
* `pager.cacheId`: the cache ID of said file. Open the `cache:id` URL
  to view the file.

### gdb

gdb should work fine too. You can attach it to buffers by putting a long
sleep call in runBuffer, then retrieving the PID as described above.
Note that this will upset seccomp, so you should compile with
`make TARGET=debug DANGER_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`.

### Debugging layout bugs

One possible workflow:

* Save page from your favorite graphical browser.
* Binary search the HTML by deleting half of the file at each step. Be
  careful to not remove any stylesheet LINK or STYLE tags.
* Binary search the CSS using the same method. You can format it using
  the graphical browser's developer tools.

The `-o start.console-buffer=false` trick (see above) is especially
useful when debugging a flow layout path that the console buffer also
needs.

Don't forget to add a test case after the fix:

```sh
$ cha -C test/layout/config.toml test/layout/my-test-case.html > test/layout/my-test-case.expected
```

Use `config.color.toml` and `my-test-case.color.expected` to preserve colors.

### Sandbox violations

First, note that a nil deref can also trigger a sandbox violation. Read
the stack trace to make sure you aren't dealing with that.

Then, figure out if it's happening in a CGI process or a buffer
process. If your buffer was swapped out for the console, it's likely the
latter; otherwise, the former.

Now change the appropriate sandbox handler from `SCMP_ACT_TRAP` to
`SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS`. Run `strace -f ./cha -o start.console-buffer [...] 2>a`,
trigger the crash, then search for "killed by SIGSYS" in `a`. Copy the
logged PID, then search backwards once; you should now see the syscall
that got your process killed.

## Resources

You may find these links useful.

### WhatWG

* HTML: <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/>. Includes everything
  and then some more.
* DOM: <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/>. Includes events, basic
  node-related stuff, etc.
* Encoding: <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/>. The core encoding
  algorithms are already implemented in Chagashi, so this is now mainly
  relevant for the TextEncoder JS interface (js/encoding).
* URL: <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/>. For some incomprehensible reason,
  it's defined as an equally incomprehensible state machine. types/url
  implements this.
* Fetch: <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/>. Networking stuff. Also see
  <https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org> for XMLHttpRequest.
* Web IDL: <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/>. Relevant for Monoucha/JS
  bindings.

Note that these sometimes change daily, especially the HTML standard.

### CSS standards

* CSS 2.1: <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/>. There's also an "Editor's
  Draft" 2.2 version: <https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/>. Not many
  differences, but usually it's worth to check 2.2 too.

Good news is that unlike WhatWG specs, these don't change daily. Bad
news is that CSS 2.1 was the last real CSS version, and newer features
are spread accross a bunch of random documents with questionable status
of stability: <https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html>.

### Other standards

It's unlikely that you will need these, but for completeness' sake:

* TOML: <https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0>. config.toml's base language.
* Mailcap: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1524>.
* Cookies: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265>.
* EcmaScript: <https://tc39.es/ecma262/> is the latest draft.

### Nim docs

* Manual: <https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html>. A detailed
  description of all language features.
* Standard library docs: <https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html>.
  Everything found in the "std/" namespace.

### MDN

MDN is useful if you don't quite understand how a certain feature is
supposed to work. It also has links to relevant standards in page
footers.
