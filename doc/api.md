# Chawan's command API

As described in <!-- MANOFF -->the [config](config.md) documentation<!-- MANON -->
<!-- MANON **cha-config**(5) MANOFF -->, keypress combinations can be bound to
actions.

An action can be either a JavaScript expression, or a command defined in the
`[cmd]` section of config.toml.  For example, the following works:

```
gpn = 'n => pager.alert(n)' # e.g. 2gpn prints `2' to the status line
```

Note however, that JavaScript functions must be called with an appropriate
`this` value. Unfortunately, this also means that the following does not work:

```
gpn = 'pager.alert' # broken!!!
```

To work around this limitation, actions have to wrap the target function in a
closure, as above. However, this has very poor reusability; for more complex
actions, you would have to copy and paste the entire function every time you
re-bind it or call it from a different function.

To fix this, it is possible to define a command in the `[cmd]` section:

```toml
[cmd.my.namespace]
showNumber = 'n => pager.alert(n)'
```

`my.namespace` can be anything you want; it is to avoid collisions when
including multiple configs. Avoid setting it to `pager` or `line`, because these
are used by the default config.

Now you can call `cmd.my.namespace.showNumber()` from any other function, or
just include it in an action:

```toml
'gpn' = 'cmd.my.namespace.showNumber'
```

## Interfaces

### Client

The global object (`globalThis`) implements the `Client` interface. Documented
functions of this are:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`quit()`</td>
<td>Exit the browser.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`suspend()`</td>
<td>Temporarily suspend the browser, by delivering the client process a
SIGTSTP signal.<br>
Note: this suspends the entire process group.</td>
</tr>

</table>

`Client` also implements various web standards normally available on the
`Window` object on websites, e.g. fetch().  Note however that it does *not* give
access to JS objects in buffers, so e.g. `globalThis.document` is not available.

### Pager

`Pager` is a separate interface from `Client` that gives access to the pager
(i.e. browser chrome). It is accessible as `globalThis.pager`, or simply
`pager`.

Following properties (functions/getters) are defined by `Pager`:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`load(url)`</td>
<td>Put the specified address into the URL bar, and optionally load it.<br>
Note that this performs auto-expansion of URLs, so Chawan will expand any
matching omni-rules (e.g. search), try to open schemeless URLs with the default
scheme/local files, etc.<br>
Opens a prompt with the current URL when no parameters are specified; otherwise,
the string passed is displayed in the prompt. If this string ends with a newline
(e.g. `pager.load("about:chawan\n")`), the URL is loaded directly.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`loadSubmit(url)`</td>
<td>Act as if `url` had been input into the address bar.<br>
Same as `pager.load(url + "\n")`.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`gotoURL(url, options = {replace: null, contentType: null})`</td>
<td>Go to the specified URL immediately (without a prompt). This differs from
`load` and `loadSubmit` in that it *does not* try to correct the URL.<br>
When `replace` is set, the new buffer may replace the old one if it loads
successfully. When `contentType` is set, the new buffer's content type is
forcefully set to that string.<br>
Use this for loading automatically retrieved (i.e. non-user-provided) URLs.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`dupeBuffer()`</td>
<td>Duplicate the current buffer by loading its source to a new buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`discardBuffer(buffer = pager.buffer, dir = pager.navDirection)`</td>
<td>Discard `buffer`, then move back to the buffer opposite to `dir`.
Possible values of `dir` are: "prev", "next", "prev-sibling", "next-sibling",
"parent", "first-child", "any".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`discardTree()`</td>
<td>Discard all child buffers of the current buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`reload()`</td>
<td>Open a new buffer with the current buffer's URL, replacing the current
buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`reshape()`</td>
<td>Reshape the current buffer (=render the current page anew.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`redraw()`</td>
<td>Redraw screen contents. Useful if something messed up the display.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`toggleSource()`</td>
<td>If viewing an HTML buffer, open a new buffer with its source. Otherwise,
open the current buffer's contents as HTML.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`lineInfo()`</td>
<td>Display information about the current line.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`searchForward()`</td>
<td>Search for a string in the current buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`searchBackward()`</td>
<td>Search for a string, backwards.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`isearchForward()`</td>
<td>Incremental-search for a string, highlighting the first result.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`isearchBackward()`</td>
<td>Incremental-search and highlight the first result, backwards.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`gotoLine(n?)`</td>
<td>Go to the line passed as the first argument.<br>
If no arguments were specified, an input window for entering a line is
shown.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`searchNext(n = 1)`</td>
<td>Jump to the nth next search result.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`searchPrev(n = 1)`</td>
<td>Jump to the nth previous search result.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`peek()`</td>
<td>Display an alert message of the current URL.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`peekCursor()`</td>
<td>Display an alert message of the URL or title under the cursor. Multiple
calls allow cycling through the two. (i.e. by default, press u once -> title,
press again -> URL)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`ask(prompt)`</td>
<td>Ask the user for confirmation. Returns a promise which resolves to a
boolean value indicating whether the user responded with yes.<br>
Can be used to implement an exit prompt like this:
```
q = 'pager.ask("Do you want to exit Chawan?").then(x => x ? pager.quit() : void(0))'
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`askChar(prompt)`</td>
<td>Ask the user for any character.<br>
Like `pager.ask`, but the return value is a character.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`saveLink()`</td>
<td>Save URL pointed to by the cursor.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`saveSource()`</td>
<td>Save the source of the current buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`extern(cmd, options = {setenv: true, suspend: true, wait: false})`
</td>
<td>Run an external command `cmd`. The `$CHA_URL` and `$CHA_CHARSET` variables
are set when `options.setenv` is true. `options.suspend` suspends the pager
while the command is being executed, and `options.wait` makes it so the user
must press a key before the pager is resumed.<br>
Returns true if the command exit successfully, false otherwise.<br>
Warning: this has a bug where the output is written to stdout even if suspend
is true. Redirect to /dev/null in the command if this is not desired. (This
will be fixed in the future.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`externCapture(cmd)`</td>
<td>Like extern(), but redirect the command's stdout string into the
result. null is returned if the command wasn't executed successfully, or if
the command returned a non-zero exit value.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`externInto(cmd, ins)`</td>
<td>Like extern(), but redirect `ins` into the command's standard input stream.
`true` is returned if the command exits successfully, otherwise the return
value is `false`.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`externFilterSource(cmd, buffer = null, contentType = null)`</td>
<td>Redirects the specified (or if `buffer` is null, the current) buffer's
source into `cmd`.<br>
Then, it pipes the output into a new buffer, with the content type `contentType`
(or, if `contentType` is null, the original buffer's content type).<br>
Returns `undefined`. (It should return a promise; TODO.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`buffer`</td>
<td>Getter for the currently displayed buffer. Returns a `Buffer` object; see
below.</td>
</tr>

</table>

### Buffer

Each buffer is exposed as an object that implements the `Buffer` interface.  To
get a reference to the currently displayed buffer, use `pager.buffer`.

Important: there exists a quirk of questionable value on pager, where accessing
properties that do not exist on the pager will dispatch those to the current
buffer (`pager.buffer`). So if you see e.g. `pager.url`, that is actually
equivalent to `pager.buffer.url`, because `Pager` has no `url` getter.

Following properties (functions/getters) are defined by `Buffer`:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>`cursorUp(n = 1)`, `cursorDown(n = 1)`</td>
<td>Move the cursor upwards/downwards by n lines, or if n is unspecified, by
1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`cursorLeft(n = 1)`, `cursorRight(n = 1)`</td>
<td>Move the cursor to the left/right by n cells, or if n is unspecified, by
1.<br>
Note: `n` right now represents cells, but really it should represent characters.
(The difference is that right now numbered cursorLeft/cursorRight is broken for
double-width chars.)</td>

<td>`cursorLineBegin()`, `cursorLineEnd()`</td>
<td>Move the cursor to the first/last cell of the line.</td>

### LineEdit

The line editor at the bottom of the screen is exposed to the JavaScript context
as `globalThis.line`, or simply `line`, and implements the `LineEdit` interface.

Note that there is no single `LineEdit` object; a new one is created every time
the line editor is opened, and when the line editor is closed, `globalThis.line`
simply returns `null`.

Following properties (functions/getters) are defined by `LineEdit`:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`submit()`</td>
<td>Submit line.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>`cancel()`</td>
