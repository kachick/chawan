# Before 2.0, `addr' only worked on mutable types, and `unsafeAddr'
# was needed to take the address of immutable ones.
#
# This was changed in 2.0 for some incomprehensible reason, so now to
# write code that compiles on both versions you have to take care that
# you use the right overload without compiler help.
#
# This module fixes the above problem; it is automatically included
# in every file by nim.cfg.
