# Licensing terms of Chawan

Chawan itself is dedicated to the public domain. However, it contains and
depends on projects with different licensing terms.

This document attempts to list licensing terms of projects included in the
Chawan repository. Note that Chawan is dynamically linked against your copy
of libcurl, (on Linux) libseccomp, your C library, and if exists, your termcap
library. For licensing terms of these, please consult the appropriate library's
documentation.

Also, Chawan is statically linked to the Nim standard library. At the time
of writing, (i.e. as of Nim 2.0.8) this is the MIT license (same terms as
the vendored Punycode library).

Table of contents:

* [Chawan](#chawan)
* [QuickJS](#quickjs)
* [Punycode library](#punycode-library)
* [STB image](#stb-image)

## QuickJS

Note that our vendored copy is not identical to upstream, as we include some
patches for integration of the QuickJS and Nim runtimes.

Special thanks to zamfofex, Bo Yao, Nick Vatamaniuc and Saúl Ibarra Corretgé
for their patches which we used during inactivity of upstream developers.
